	This is the basic tag structure for an XSeen display
	* defines the canvas region (scene tag)
	* defines two lights (light tag). This only has an effect if there is geometry to illuminate
	* defines a camera (camera tag) and indicates that it circles the object (turntable)
	The next example (solids.html) adds some geometry to the scene
